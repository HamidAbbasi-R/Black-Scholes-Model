Try the app on streamlit servers [here](https://hamidabbasi-r-black-scholes-model-black-scholes-ziq8wr.streamlit.app/). This project is an interactive dashboard designed to help users understand and explore the Black-Scholes model for pricing European options. It also includes advanced features like Monte Carlo simulations, and implied volatility calculations. Built using Python, Streamlit, Plotly, and SciPy.

## Features
- **Black-Scholes Formula**: Derive and visualize the theoretical price of European call and put options.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Simulate option prices using Monte Carlo methods.
- **Implied Volatility Calculator**: Compute implied volatility from market prices using nonlinear solvers.


## Usage
Adjust the input parameters (stock price, strike price, volatility, etc.) using sliders and explore the results dynamically.
